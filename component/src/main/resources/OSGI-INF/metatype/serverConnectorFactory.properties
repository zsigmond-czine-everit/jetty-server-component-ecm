org.everit.jetty.server.component.ecm.ServerConnectorFactory.name=Everit Jetty Server Connector Factory
org.everit.jetty.server.component.ecm.ServerConnectorFactory.description=

connectionFactoryFactories.target.name=ConnectionFactory factories (target)
connectionFactoryFactories.target.description=OSGi filter expressions that point to OSGi services that implement the ConnectionFactoryFactory interface. In case no service reference is specified, a standard HttpConnectionFactory is used.

acceptorPriorityDelta.name=Acceptor thread priority delta
acceptorPriorityDelta.description=This allows the acceptor thread to run at a different priority. Typically this would be used to lower the priority to give preference to handling previously accepted connections rather than accepting new connections.

acceptQueueSize.name=Accept queue size
acceptQueueSize.description=The accept queue size (also known as accept backlog)

defaultProtocol.name=Default protocol
defaultProtocol.description=The protocol factory used for newly accepted connections. Defaults to the protocol of the first configured factory.

idleTimeout.name=Idle timeout
idleTimeout.description=Sets the maximum Idle time for a connection. This value is interpreted as the maximum time between some progress being made on the connection. So if a single byte is read or written, then the timeout is reset.

inheritChannel.name=Inherit channel
inheritChannel.description=Whether this connector uses a channel inherited from the JVM. If true, the connector first tries to inherit from a channel provided by the system. If there is no inherited channel available, or if the inherited channel is not usable, then it will fall back using ServerSocketChannel. Use it with xinetd/inetd, to launch an instance of Jetty on demand. The port used to access pages on the Jetty instance is the same as the port used to launch Jetty.

name.name=Name
name.description=Set a connector name. A context may be configured with virtual hosts in the form "@contextname" and will only serve requests from the named connector,

service.description.name=Service description
service.description.description=Optional description for Server Connector Factory instance.

reuseAddress.name=Reuse address
reuseAddress.description=Whether the server socket reuses addresses

lingerTime.name=Linger time
lingerTime.description=The linger time. Use -1 to disable.

selectorPriorityDelta.name=Selector priority delta
selectorPriorityDelta.description=Sets the selector thread priority delta to the given amount. This allows the selector threads to run at a different priority. Typically this would be used to lower the priority to give preference to handling previously accepted connections rather than accepting new connections.
