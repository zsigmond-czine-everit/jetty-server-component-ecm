org.everit.jetty.server.component.ecm.HttpConnectionFactoryFactory.name=Everit Jetty HttpConnectionFactory Factory
org.everit.jetty.server.component.ecm.HttpConnectionFactoryFactory.description=Component to create HTTPConnectionFactory instances.

delayDispatchUntilContent.name=Delay dispatch until content
delayDispatchUntilContent.description=If true, delay the application dispatch until content is available

inputBufferSize.name=Input buffer size
inputBufferSize.description=Size of input buffer of the created connections

customizers.target.name=Customizers (target)
customizers.target.description=Customizers are invoked for every request received. Customizers are often used to interpret optional headers (eg ForwardedRequestCustomizer) or optional protocol semantics (eg SecureRequestCustomizer).

headerCacheSize.name=Header cache size
headerCacheSize.description=The maximum allowed size in bytes for a HTTP header field cache

outputBufferSize.name=Output buffer size
outputBufferSize.description=The size of the buffer into which response content is aggregated before being sent to the client. A larger buffer can improve performance by allowing a content producer to run without blocking, however larger buffers consume more memory and may induce some latency before a client starts processing the content.

outputAggregationSize.name=Output aggregation size
outputAggregationSize.description=The size of the buffer into which response content is aggregated before being sent to the client. A larger buffer can improve performance by allowing a content producer to run without blocking, however larger buffers consume more memory and may induce some latency before a client starts processing the content. The default value of this property is "output buffer size / 4".

requestHeaderSize.name=Request header size
requestHeaderSize.description=The maximum size of a request header. Larger headers will allow for more and/or larger cookies plus larger form content encoded in a URL. However, larger headers consume more memory and can make a server more vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

responseHeaderSize.name=Response header size
responseHeaderSize.description=The maximum size of a response header. Larger headers will allow for more and/or larger cookies and longer HTTP headers (eg for redirection). However, larger headers will also consume more memory.

securePort.name=Secure port
securePort.description=The TCP/IP port used for CONFIDENTIAL and INTEGRAL redirections.

secureScheme.name=Secure scheme
secureScheme.description=The URI scheme used for CONFIDENTIAL and INTEGRAL redirections.

sendDateHeader.name=Send date header
sendDateHeader.description=

sendServerVersion.name=Send server version
sendServerVersion.description=

sendXPoweredBy.name=Send x-powered-by
sendXPoweredBy.description=

service.description.name=Service description
service.description.description=Optional description for the instantiated HttpConnectionFactory Factory.
